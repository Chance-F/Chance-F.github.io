  			<h1>Controls</h1>
  				<p>League of Legends plays differently than most games in the mainstream.  It requires the player to use a mouse and a keyboard and NO you don't move with W,A,S,D.  Controls in league can be split up into 4 categories.  Movement, Basic attacks, main abilites, and Summoner Spells.</p>
  			<h2>Movement</h2>
          <p>Unlike most PC games, league does not use the usual W,A,S,D to move your character or "Champion" around.  League actually uses the mouse to move and attack.  To move your character to the desired location simply right click on the ground where you want to go.  The same goes for picking a target to attack.  If you wish to attack another champion, simply point and right click on them.</p>
        <h3>Basic Attacks</h3>
          <p>Basic attacks are the simplest form of attack in League.  Every champion has their own type of basic attack.  This usually consists of something very simple such as hitting someone with a sword if youre a melee champion or shooting them with a projectile if youre a marksman.  To perform the basic attack simply hover your mouse over the desired target and right click on them. Below is an example of what it would look like to basic attack.</p>
          <img class="basic" src="basicattack.jpg">
        <h4>Main Abilites</h4>
          <p>For your main abilites you will be using the Q,W,E,and R keys.  Q,W,and E are general abilites and R is your ultimate ability.  The types of abilities bound to these keys can be anything from skill shots, point and click abilities, stuns, roots, knock ups, or slows.  The Ultimate ability is different per champion as well and can anything from, large amounts of damage, large amount of healing, or some form of Area of Effect ability like a root, slow, explosion etc.  Below I have added a spotlight video of one of my favorite marskman champions, Tristana.  It will cover everything about her!</p>

        <h5>Summoner Spells</h5>
          <p>One of the last basic pieces of control are Summoner Spells.  These are two spells that you get to choose before each match that you would choose based on what situation you are going to be in the game.  I will explain the different situations on the "Gameplay" page.  Summoner spells are triggered simply by click D or F, depending on what key you placed each summoner spell.  Here is a list of all of the available summoner spells and what they do:
            <ul>
              <li><img class="summoner-spells" src="heal.jpg">Heal: Simply heals you and your allies within range</li>
